<h1>About Me</h1>

  New Delhi. My love for this vibrant city runs deep, from its rich history to its diverse culture and 
  mouthwatering cuisine. Living here has fueled my enthusiasm for exploration and appreciation of all 
  things Delhi has to offer.

  One of my standout skills is my proficiency behind the wheel. I take pride in my driving abilities, 
  navigating the chaotic streets of Delhi with ease and confidence. Whether it's a leisurely drive 
  through the city or a long road trip, I ensure a smooth and safe journey for myself and those
   accompanying me.

  Currently pursuing my BTech, I am deeply engaged in the world of technology. With a knack for web 
  development and SQL, I find immense joy in crafting digital solutions and building functional 
  websites. But my thirst for knowledge doesn't end there. I'm always eager to expand my skill set, 
  whether it's honing my cooking abilities or embarking on new adventures to broaden my horizons. 
  From the serene hills of Himachal Pradesh to the bustling markets of Mumbai, I've explored diverse 
  landscapes across India, each journey leaving me with unforgettable memories and a deeper 
  appreciation for the beauty of my homeland.
