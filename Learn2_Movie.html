<h1> Movies Watched By Me From March 2024 </h1>
<h2> The Recent Movies I have watched </h2>
<hr />
<h3> Vesper </h3>
<p> It was a nice sci-fi movie that has potential to do more. It is now incomplete maybe there will be a second part. But yes the starting
    or you can say story building was very good.
</p>
<h3>Kung Fu Panda 3 </h3>
<p> It is one of the best animated movies I have ever watched. It has 2 more prequels. I have watched it earlier also but it was worth a 
    rewatch
</p>
<h3>Vikram Veda</h3>
<p>It is a south indian movie, I would say it is underrated movie. The story the cast everything is awesome. It has thriller and mystery 
    genre.
